## Usage

### Writinng Specs

If you want to learn how to write functional specs with Gauge, please take a look at:
* https://gauge.org/getting-started-guide/create-specification/

Or if you want to customize Taiko generated functional tests:
* https://taiko.gauge.org/#integrating-gauge

### Running automation

The following commands can be executed at the root of this project, after installation.

#### `npm run build`

Interprets and generate your `.spec` files, placed at `./specs/`, in order to generate a `./tests/generated_implementation.js` with the functional tests.

#### `npm start`

Starts Gauge specs processing, reading all `.spec` files placed at `./specs/`.  
Then relates all steps texts to `./test/generated_implementation.js` and runs Taiko with browser automation.

#### `npm test`

Runs all aspect source code unit testing.

## Solving problems
